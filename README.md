# Server Deployments

~~Git Repository for my kubernetes cluster. Gets synced by [ArgoCD](https://argocd.nycode.dev).~~

## ⚠️ Note
This was my git repository for doing GitOps with [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
While it was a really nice experience and really fun to do, it was also completely overkill and overengineered for my poor little single node cluster.
I now started to explore [NixOS](https://nixos.org) and I'm now using that to manage my server declaratively.

I'll leave the repo here so maybe one or another can learn something from this.
Have a great day! :3
